# Editor
I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/). This has mssivly helped my
productivity. Prior to this I used VSCode, the plugin system VSCode
has is incredible, and obviously very user friendly. Currently, I
haven't utilised NeoVim's `lua` library to the extent I would like.

# Terminal
I use the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-terminal)
this is shockingly good. At some point I might move away from this.
I also use [TMux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for my terminal
sessions. Combining this with [tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect)
and [tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum)
allows me to keep my terminal instanes between restarts of my PC.
This is such a nice workflow that emulates some of VSCode's auto-opening of tabs.

# Auto-complete
I use [Codeium](https://codeium.com/), simply because it is a great free tool, and I don't want to pay for
[Copilot](https://copilot.io/).

# OS
I use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), specifically an
Ubuntu installation. I would like to be on a native [Linux] installation, but
unfortunately I have to interact with [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/).

# Source Control
I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com).

# Oh My ZSH
Blah
