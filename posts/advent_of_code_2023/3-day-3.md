# [Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

Our first maze-like problem. This is a staple of AoC, having a 2-dimensional search
space is breakfast for us.

# Part I
## Question
Given the below 'engine', we need to find those numbers that are adjacent to at least a
single 'symbol' (i.e. `*`, `#`, `+`, and `$`).

```
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

## My Solution
Let's use the freshly learnt `Attoparsec` to parse the data.
