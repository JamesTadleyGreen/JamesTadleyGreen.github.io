# The Problem

Before the implementation of the below, the only way anyone in the business could tell
how close a job was to completing packing was to venture over the road and visually 
inspect the progress. This is obviously less than ideal, and caused a lot of bureaucratic overhead.

# A Job-level Solution
For a given job our solution was a dashboard, as mentioned in [Pack Analysis](2-pack-analysis.html)
we already had scanning packs in and out. So all the data was there, ready to be harnessed.
I created a simple dashboard that incorporated the expected time to finish alongside
the pack types and total packs.
