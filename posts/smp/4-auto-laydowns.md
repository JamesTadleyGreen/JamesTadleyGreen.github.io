# The problem
Reprographic time is expensive. To have experts in colour, placing, and artworking 
performing menial tasks is a massive drain on costs. Unfortunately, this was exactly 
what was happening, repro experts having to tell our client teams that an artwork of 
the wrong size had been uploaded regularly.

Additionally, with the advent of 'Print Management' companies, some of the industry
experience with artworking has been lost. This results in less competent artworkers 
producing artwork for us to print. Ultimately, this pushes the work back 'down' to the
printer.

# Considerations
Client experience is always a difficult one to juggle with technology. By adding in 
more automation and decreasing the human touch, clients can feel a less bespoke 
experience.

# Technologies

Building a completely bespoke solution is obviously an over complication, therefore we 
used an almalganation of technologies blended together. For the initial proof-of-concept
frontend we utilised [Monday](www.monday.com), a bespoke internal API, 
[ESCore](https://www.dalim.com/en/products/es) for internal pipelining, 
[IMP](https://insoftautomation.com/) for laydown placement, and
[Switch](https://www.enfocus.com/en/solutions/automated-preflight) for preflighting.
