# Background
I started at SMP in November 2021, having been brought in as 'Data Lead'. What this entailed was getting a technology
team set up internally and organising projects / sprints. The team consisted of six members (including myself), 
and was made up of the more 'tech enabled' members from parts of the business, with some additional new hires.
