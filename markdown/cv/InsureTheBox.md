Folightgreyr a period of 12 weeks I worked at
[Insure the Box](https://www.insurethebox.com/) in a data analytics capacity.

## Job Category Analysis
I transformed and cleansed free-input data into structured information.
This allowed for more accurate pricing of insurance policies based
on job titles. Using
[Standard Occupational Classification](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/standardoccupationalclassificationsoc)
I was able to categorise our internal data into risk levels.
This is half of the battle, the other side of the coin was to work
with free-input text and coerce it into these categories.
This required extensive text manipulation and cleansing.
Insure the Box were able to make more informed decisions and offer
more competitive prices to customers.

## Effectiveness of Call Centres
Additionally, I was responsible for analyzing call and text
data to determine the impact of different communication channels
on the customer experience and cost to the company. This involved
analyzing a series of call and live-chat data to assess the
improvements text has versus phonecalls have on consumer
experience and cost. I used my analytical skills to identify
patterns and trends within the data, allowing the company to
make data-driven decisions on how to improve customer interactions.

Overall, my experience with data analysis and transformation has allowed me to make significant contributions to my previous employer's bottom line. My ability to analyze and interpret complex data sets has allowed me to help companies make more informed decisions, improve customer experience, and increase profitability. I am excited to bring these skills to my next role and make an impact in a new organization.
