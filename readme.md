# My Blog

This is where I put my ideas, ranging from work to personal projects. It is a collection
of my thoughts, ideas, and opinions.

# Blog Structure

## Posts

Posts sit, unsurprisingly, in the `/posts` directory. If they are a 'one-off' post,
they are named:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

If they are part of a series they sit in a folder of parts, where each part is
named:
- `PARTNUMBER-YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

This allows us to render series posts with a table of contents.
